--COFFEE SHOP DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION--
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW
--------
This program is designed to analyze coffee shop data using Python. It processes datasets related to coffee seed suppliers, new product launches, menu optimization, price sensitivity, and competitor analysis. Visualizations are generated using pastel color schemes for better readability and presentation.

DEPENDENCIES

The program requires the following Python libraries:

1)pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
2)numpy: For numerical operations and generating random data.
3)matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
4)seaborn: For enhanced visualizations with attractive color themes.

Install these libraries using:

-->pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

DATASET GENERATION

 Coffee Seed Data:
>>Columns: Supplier, Year, Seeds Bought (kg), Sales Generated ($)
>>Random data generated for analysis and saved in Coffee_Seeds.csv.
 Product Launch Data:
>>Columns: ProductLaunch, Sales
(Simulates sales performance of newly launched products.)
 Menu Data:
>>Columns: MenuItem, Sales
(Tracks the sales of various menu items to optimize the offerings.)
 Price Sensitivity Data:
>>Columns: Price, Sales
(Analyzes how changes in pricing affect sales.)
 Competitor Analysis Data:
>>Columns: Competitor, Sales, Rating
(Compares sales and customer ratings of major coffee shop competitors.)

FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS

>>new_product_launches(df)
Aggregates sales based on new product launches.
Generates a bar chart visualizing the sales of newly launched products.

>>menu_optimization(df)
Summarizes total sales for each menu item.
Visualizes which items contribute most to overall sales using a bar chart.

>>price_sensitivity(df)
Examines how different price points impact sales.
Creates a line graph showing sales trends relative to pricing.

>>competitor_analysis(df)
Analyzes average sales and customer ratings of competitors.
Displays the data using a bar chart to highlight strong and weak performers.

DATA VISUALISATION

-->All graphs use pastel color palettes for visual appeal.
Graphs display without requiring manual closing, allowing multiple charts to be open simultaneously.

FILE OUTPUT

The coffee seed supplier data is saved as a CSV file named Coffee_Seeds.csv.

USUAGE INSTRUCTIONS

=Run the program using any Python IDE or terminal.
=Ensure all dependencies are installed.
=The program will automatically display graphs for each analysis.

CONCLUSION

This program provides a comprehensive analysis of coffee shop operations, including product performance, pricing strategies, and competitive benchmarking. The generated visual insights can help optimize sales strategies and supplier decisions.
